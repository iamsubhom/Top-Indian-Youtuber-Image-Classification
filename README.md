# Youtuber Image Classification Project

## Overview

In this data science and machine learning project, we aim to classify youtube personalities from a curated list of top individuals. The selected personalities for classification include:

1. AJAY NAGAR
2. AMIT BHADANA
3. ASHISH CHANCHLANI
4. BHUVAN BAM
5. DILRAJ SINGH RAWAT
6. GAURAV CHAUDHARY
7. NISCHAY MALHAN
8. SANDEEP MAHESHWARI
9. UJJWAL CHAURASIA

The project is organized into the following components:

1. **UI (User Interface):** Contains the code for the web interface.
2. **server:** Python Flask server for handling HTTP requests.
3. **model:** Python notebooks for data cleaning, model building, and training.
4. **images_dataset:** Dataset used for model training.
5. **Technologies:** Python, Numpy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask.

## Technologies Used

## Python Libraries
- **Numpy:** Used for numerical operations and data cleaning.
- **OpenCV:** Employed for image processing and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Utilized for data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn (Sklearn):** Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.

## IDEs
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive and collaborative development.
- **Visual Studio Code & PyCharm:** Integrated development environments for code editing and project management.

## Web Development
- **Flask:** Python web framework for building the HTTP server.

## Frontend Technologies
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Used for creating the user interface.

# Model Building

The model building process is documented in the `model` folder. It includes Jupyter notebooks where the data is cleaned, visualized, and the machine learning model is trained using Scikit-Learn.

# Web Interface

The `UI` folder contains the code for the web interface. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Server

The `server` folder consists of Python files for the Flask server, responsible for handling HTTP requests, communicating with the model, and providing responses to the UI.

# Conclusion

This project combines data science, machine learning, and web development to classify sports personalities. The chosen technologies and folder structure provide a clear organization for collaborative development and easy maintenance.
